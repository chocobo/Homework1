=========

## Hours:
5-6 I think. At least 70% of that was on TTTAttributedLabel.

## Completed:
  * Add a container view and modify properties: backgroundColor, cornerRadius, font, textColor, shadowOffset.
  * Add buttons with different images for default and highlighted.
  * Add UIImageViews and choose the right mode: aspect fill, aspect fit, etc.
  * Add a UITextField with a background image.
  * Add UILabels with attributed text (instead of plain text), so that you can bold individual words.
  * Setup CocoaPods for managing 3rd party libraries and use TTTAttributedLabel to style the link and make it clickable
  * Optional: Move the textfield when the keyboard appears.
